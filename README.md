## CDC abortion surveillance 2010-2019

NA: Reporting area did not report, or data not reportable by CDC.	

** Reporting area did not report, or only reported by occurrence; because abortion numbers by residence are available only from other reporting areas where residents obtained abortions, data by state/area of maternal residence should be interpreted with caution.
